# Concepts

## Grants 

A grant is an open source public goods project that has the opportunity to receive community funding and find user traction.

## Grant Rounds 

Grant rounds are collections of grants that are subject to additional funding through a matching pool for a given period of time (e.g. quarterly for Gitcoin Grant Rounds). On top of the individual amount these projects raise from contributors, there is also a portion of the grant round matching pool that is awarded to each grant based on a quadratic funding model. You can find more information [here](https://wtfisqf.com/) on quadratic funding. 

The current version only allows the dGrants (decentralized grants) core team to create grant rounds. We will open this functionality to the community in future updates! 

## Grant Owners, Funders and Contributors 

Grant owners can be one or multiple people, but generally is the team building and coordinating a specific project that the web3.0 community finds meaningful. If you're a grant owner, head to our [Grant Owner's Guide](/docs/grant-owners-guide/create-edit-grants) for tutorials and more. 

Funding for a grant, and respectively, for grant owners, can come from two sources: contributors and matching pool funders. 

Contributors are community patrons who want to support and fund a particular project submitted by an owner. It usually means they have used the project in their own work, were an open source contributor to it, or simply are interested in the mission and premise of a project and wish to see it succeed. If you're a contributor, head to our [Contributor's Guide](/docs/contributors-guide/add-to-cart-checkout) for tutorials and more. 

Matching pool funders are donors who provide funds to a grant round. These funds are distributed to grants within a grant round based on the quadratic matching formula. If you're a matching pool funder, head to our [Funder's Guide](/docs/funders-guide/fund-grant-round) for tutorials and more. 

## Cart 

Similar to the shopping cart in common ecommerce platforms, the cart is where you can add all the grants you are interested in supporting.

## Checking Out 

Once you have confirmed all the grants you would like to support, you can checkout the cart. Once the transaction is successfully confirmed, the funds are used in the quadratic funding calculation and are claimable by the grant owners once the round is over.
